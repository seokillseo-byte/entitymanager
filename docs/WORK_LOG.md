# Work Log

## 2026-10-08

- Confirmed repository: `seokillseo-byte/entitymanager`.
- Repository was empty at initialization time.
- Added project README.
- Added professional vibe coding plan.
- Added master prompt for switching ChatGPT/Codex sessions or accounts.
- Added next steps tracker.
- Clarified critical product requirement: EntityManager must be a Windows PC desktop tool opened by clicking an `.exe` file.
- Updated planning direction from local SaaS-style app to desktop-first app.

## Current Decision

The project should be built as a professional Windows desktop Entity Builder + Entity Care + EEAT Growth Platform, not merely an account creation tool.

Preferred V1 stack: Tauri desktop shell, React dashboard UI, local SQLite database, local workflow state machine, configurable AI/CAPTCHA/email/proxy integrations, and future Chrome Extension support.

Normal users should not need Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, or terminal commands to use the packaged `.exe`.

## Next Recommended Action

Start Phase 1: desktop application foundation with monorepo, Tauri app, React dashboard shell, SQLite schema, shared types, local workflow skeleton, and Windows `.exe` build notes.
